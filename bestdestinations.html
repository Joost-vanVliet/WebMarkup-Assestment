            <h2>London</h2>
            <p>
                London is the capital of England and Great-Britain, London is a city with many things to see and more opportunities to find interesting things. When you are in London you will immediately notice that your happiness has disappeared. This is because it is forbidden to be happy when within 2 kilometers of a British person. For this reason only those who whish to not be happy go to London and that is why we recommend it to every Dutch person. Because Dutch people famously don’t like fun.

            <h2>Bangkok</h2>
            <p>
                Bangkok is the capital of Thailand, a beautiful and exotic city full of mystical wonders and fascinating buildings. Explore amazing landmarks such as the imperial palace and amazing temples like Wat Arun. Also you can buy anything you want for a <em>tenth of the price</em> and less then half the quality because there are a lot of knock-off vendors in this city. And there is that other thing I will not say, but you know what I mean.

            <h2>Sydney</h2>
            <p>
                Sydney is not the capital of Australia, but it is the largest/most important city.

            <h2>Stockholm</h2>
            <p>
                Stockholm is the capital of Sweden and a fascinating city. After the success of the video game “”Minecraft” the Swedish government decided that Sweden should look like the game, for this reason the entirety of Sweden is build with 1 by 1 meter cubes. This makes Sweden an unforgettable destination that will leave you confused and awestruck at the sight of a land made of blocks.<em> This is real, everyone who says it is not is lying.</em>
